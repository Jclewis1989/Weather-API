# Weather API

A very small example of how to use fetch in JS, with a weather API. You will still need to get an API key as I removed this for my own security and API key protection

## Getting Started

If you want this to work, you will need to go to Open Weather, create an account and generate an API key. Fork, clone or download the zip and extract to yoru desktop. Implement the API key from Open Weather

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the API key, and JavaScript enabled in the browser
